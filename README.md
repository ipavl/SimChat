SimChat
================

Author: Ian P (ippavlin)

This was a random project that I made to experiment with reading and
writing text to and from files. It simulates a chat room by generating
usernames by selecting two random words from a list and appending a number
to the end of this combination. It then takes a random sentence from a list
and "sends" it to the "chat" (a list box). Originally, I had "commands" in 
order to help me learn about Subs and Functions in VB.NET, but have since 
removed those when I forked this off of that version to create a "cleaner" 
program.
